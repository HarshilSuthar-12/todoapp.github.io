Adding Tasks: When a user enters a task in the input field and clicks the "Add" button, JavaScript captures the value and dynamically creates a new list item to display the task in the list.

Marking Tasks as Completed: By attaching event listeners to the list items, JavaScript can toggle a "completed" class when a user clicks on a task. This allows for visual indication of completed tasks.

Deleting Tasks: Another event listener can be added to each list item to handle the deletion of tasks. When the user clicks the "Delete" button associated with a task, JavaScript removes the corresponding list item from the DOM.
